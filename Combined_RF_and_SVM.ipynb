    "Here we will train two models, a Random Forest Model and a Support Vector Machine.\n",
    "We will then combine and average their outcomes. \n",
    "Combining these two models will hopefully work to give us a much better accuracy for predicting fake news. Both models work in different ways;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision Trees in a random forest are all trained independently on subsets of the data. Each tree looks at random parts of the text and decides wether it thinks the news is real or fake, then a final decision is reached by whatever the majority of trees decided.\n",
    "    - RFs are less prone to outlier influence as its result depends on the outcomes of multiple trees\n",
    "    - The randomness of feature selection, and of the data each tree trains on, helps ensure that the model will give more accurate predictions for unseen data \n",
    "\n",
    "- The Support Vector Machine will try and create the best decision boundary it can to separate real and fake news. If all news articles were plotted as dots on a graph, the SVM would try and fine the best line it can that separates the real ones from the fake ones, where the line is as far from any articles as it can be.\n",
    "    - SVMs work well for classifying complex data, as data can be mapped in a higher dimension, making it easier to find a decision boundary (We can choose what kernel to use for the model, which decides how to form the decision boundary)\n",
    "    - Also generalizes well to unseen data \n",
    "\n",
    "If we combine both methods we can combine the strengths of both models and potentially get more accurate predictions."
